# TG-Nekos

This code implements a Telegram bot that allows users to enable and disable a "nekomode" feature in a chat. When nekomode is enabled, users can trigger various commands (e.g., /waifu, /neko, /hug) to receive cute images or animations of anime-style characters. The bot uses the nekos.py library and an external API to fetch the images/animations based on the specified commands.
